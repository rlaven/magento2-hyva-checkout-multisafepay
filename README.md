# MultiSafepay module for Hyva Checkout

This is the module of our new Magento 2 Hyva Checkout integration.

Before you get started with MultiSafepay and Hyva Checkout, please read and follow our [installation & configuration manual](https://docs.multisafepay.com/integrations/plugins/magento2/) first.

Please note that at the moment we are only supporting redirect payment methods in combination with Hyva Checkout. More features will be added in future releases.

## About MultiSafepay ##
MultiSafepay is a collecting payment service provider which means we take care of the agreements, technical details and payment collection required for each payment method. You can start selling online today and manage all your transactions from one place.

## Supported Payment Methods ##
The supported Payment Methods for this module can be found over here: [Payment Methods & Giftcards](https://docs.multisafepay.com/plugins/magento2/faq/#available-payment-methods-in-magento-2)

## Requirements
- To use the plugin you need a MultiSafepay account. You can create a test account on https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup
- Magento Open Source version 2.3.x & 2.4.x
- PHP 7.1+

## Installation
This package does not work yet with the MultiSafepay_Graphql module. 
Please disable the module first, if you have it installed.

Add our package to the PaymentMethodsRepo section in the reactapp package.json:

```
"config": {
    "paymentMethodsRepo": {
        "multisafepay": "git@github.com:multisafepay/magento2-hyva-checkout-multisafepay.git"
    }
},
```

If you are using [**Hyv√§ Checkout Example Template**](https://github.com/hyva-themes/magento2-checkout-example), then you should use below configuration instead of above.

File: `src/reactapp/package.json`
```
"config": {
    "paymentMethodsRepo": {
        "multisafepay": "git@github.com:multisafepay/magento2-hyva-checkout-multisafepay.git -b hyva-checkout-example-template"
    }
},
   ``` 

Install the MultiSafepay package:
```
npm install
```

After that, add the MultiSafepay renderer to reactapp/src/paymentMethods/paymentConfig.json:

```
{"availablePaymentMethods":[
    "multisafepay"
]}
```

Make sure to rebuild the project with:
```shell
npm run build
```
